# Tada

A very minimal todo list application.
It let's you  create a new todo list secured by a list specific password.

You can visit that todo list with this password and:
* Add items with a due date and a tag
* Order items
* Change the status of items
* And be happily organized!

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
